Personal Config
===============

This is just a collection of personal config files or _dotfiles_. I
manage them using GNU Stow and that's the only dependency. Just go to
your home folder and run

	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/kcolford/config
	cd config
	stow base

Note that there are a number of `.csv` files in the main directory
that represent sources for various projects and things that are useful
on the internet.
